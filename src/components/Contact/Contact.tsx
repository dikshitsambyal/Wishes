  On your special day, I just want to tell you how much you mean to me. Youâ€™ve always been my biggest inspiration, my loudest cheerleader, and the person who makes even the ordinary moments unforgettable. Watching you grow into the amazing person you are today has been one of the greatest blessings of my life.
